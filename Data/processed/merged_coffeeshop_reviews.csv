In addition, it is a good place to study. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The girl that was taking our was very friendly and helped with our choice of desserts. The interior is relaxing and beautiful. The armchairs were a bit uncomfortable, as I am only 1.56. The tartlets were delicious. We had an apple and strawberry tartlets. I liked strawberry one more. The croissant was a bit dry. The best thing is that they have outside seats as well. Also, it was a bit cool, so it was great that they had blankets. In general, I really enjoyed my time here and will go here more.",positive

I recently visited this café, and it was a delightful experience.

The highlight of my visit was their coffee, which was rich, flavorful, and expertly brewed. Paired with their tiramisu, it created a perfect harmony of taste. The tiramisu was light, creamy, and had just the right balance of coffee and sweetness—a true indulgence!

The atmosphere at Second Cup is warm and inviting, with comfortable seating and a modern, clean design. Whether you’re catching up on work, chatting with friends, or just enjoying a quiet moment to yourself, the vibe here is ideal.

The staff were friendly and attentive, making the experience even more enjoyable. They made sure everything was just right and served with a smile.

If you’re in Baku and looking for a relaxing spot to enjoy great coffee and desserts, I highly recommend Second Cup. It’s a wonderful retreat from the city buzz and a place where every sip and bite feels like a treat!",positive

I have travelled the world from the temples of Mexico to the blue waters of the Indian Ocean and then some. On our travels it is paramount that “Great” not good coffee accompanies us! If you claim to be a coffee shop and sell illy then please don’t bother, many of us have awoken to what is expected when it comes to high quality gourmet coffee. That said I can heartily recommend a visit to United Coffee Beans. The staff are knowledgeable and fantastic, the choice of coffee superb, so much so we returned for a second visit and this time to have breakfast.

The Founder and Co-Owner Parviz is such a friendly and approachable person who is happy to answer any questions and also offer his expertise as he also roasts the beans on the premises which actually can be seen!!!

When in Baku take the time to explore the little side streets and maybe you too will discover hidden gems like United Coffee Beans.
