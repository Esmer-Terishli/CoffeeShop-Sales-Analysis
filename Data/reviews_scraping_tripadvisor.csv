PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,5,Amazing Experience and Delicious Food,"Last week, my family and I had a wonderful dinner at Paul Caspian. The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant and cozy. The staff were very polite and attentive. The food was truly excellent. I highly recommend trying the Shrimp Salad , it was absolutely delightful and still lingers in my memory. The presentation of the dishes was also impressive. The prices were quite reasonable as well. We will definitely be coming back. Highly recommend to everyone!",positive
PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,4,"Fantastic Breakfast, ok service","Variety and taste of food especially for breakfast is very good. The service at the take away counter is amazing, however the waiters in the restaurant itself need to learn better English (especially with all the Expats living in this area) and really need to learn how to please guests. I do not expect high service skills, but passion and enjoyment in the job could really help to make a good experience for the guest.",positive
PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,5,Cheese soupy visit,"I went to Paul to eat ""onion soup in bread"" with my boyfriend. But then we decided to order cheese soup. The soup has unique view, it is served in bread. And the taste was otherworldly. I did not expect that tasty cheese soup. Overall, it is good choice for cold weather. üòä",positive
PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,3,Breakfast,"Paul in the Caspian Plaza building. Two days in a row I eat breakfast at this place. On the first day, the ordered salmon croissant arrived about 20 minutes later, and then after I reminded you of it, when the coffee had cooled. I paid the bill in cash and..., change returned less by about $2. Nobody was surprised when I said that and got the missing money back. 
On the second day, instead of a salmon croissant, a regular croissant was served, and instead of a large cup of coffee, a small one. Corrected. Salt, pepper, coffee spoon, napkins should be asked for separately, they will not bring. Unpleasant and sad.",negative
PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,1,Awful service and terrible management,"The management is terrible in this restaurant. Every time there is a problem with something. There is always a shortage of staff, there is always a lack of ingredients, there are always mismatches with the order. If you came to have breakfast 30 minutes before it finishes be aware that you might not even get a menu before they stop serving it. One of the worst services I‚Äôve ever seen.",negative
PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,2,Dont expect to eat at same time as your company‚Ä¶,"Too many times I am sitting here after all company have received and finished their food, to have to cancel my meal as everyone is waiting for me to be even served.

They just can‚Äôt manage that simple requirement of serving people in the same group together, but rather serve what comes available first.  Main courses for one person coming at the same time as the starter for another, while the third person could wait to the very end, not to receive anything‚Ä¶. Very disappointing.",neutral
PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,3,"If you are into proper pastries, dont go there","Not our favourite anymore, we give it a try last couple of times, every time it gets worse. Pastries like croissant and palmier are the same as it used to be. A palmier was like a piece of Rock not crunchy at all. A croissant was like a ordinary bun. Not crunchy outside, not soft inside, not enough butter. Total disappointment, dont waste your money and time there.
Moreover when you complain about the pastries, they try to convince you that it is fresh. They dont even refund even if you leave on table uneaten.",negative
PAUL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293934-d6522592-Reviews-PAUL-Baku_Absheron_Region.html,2,"Bad, bad service","How can you make such a frustrating experience out of a simple take-away order (few bakery products and a coffee) ? The place was completely empty (3 waiters chatting among themselves, no other client), so no excuse on that level. Asked for a separate billing in advance. They confirmed this wouldn't be a problem. 
When payment came, no separate bill. At that point it was too late to reset the bill. Ok, this can happen. Then i wait for the coffee. Apparently they forgot to start making it. Ok again, this can happen too. Fast forward to 5 minutes later (for a simple americano !), finally the order is ready. When opening the coffee at home, it appears to be a cappucino instead of americano.

Bad reviews are not my thing. Nevertheless, this kind of deliberate unprofessionalism deserves some online recognition.",neutral

The waiters, a breed apart, are the epitome of politeness, loaded with a preemptive courtesy that‚Äôs rare in these parts. Their uniforms, a testament to the relentless pursuit of perfection, are impeccably ironed and spotlessly clean. The service? Stellar. A solid five-star performance that makes you feel like royalty in exile.

The food presents itself with an allure that‚Äôs both fresh and fetching, a visual feast before it even hits your taste buds. And the coffee ‚Äî let me tell you about the coffee. It‚Äôs the kind of high-caliber brew that shocks you into a state of pleasant surprise, the best damn cup I've had in Baku. I know coffee, and this, my friends, is coffee.

The prices? They won‚Äôt knock you on your back in this city. The place itself, situated smack in the heart of the city, offers a cool escape with air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and plenty of sockets for the tech-weary traveler.

On Tuesday I had a city centre meeting so went into Paul‚Äôs near Hardrock cafe.
It took 3 people to try to make the coffee, I waited 7 minutes for said coffee.
When eventually having had to call the manager I got my coffee, it was impossible to drink, it was so hot- when I did drink it, the milk was off, it was disgusting, no coffee, hot milk!
I went back to inform, the girl I spoke to was rude, she ‚Äòknows the milk was not off‚Äô and ‚Äòthe coffee was good‚Äô 
Why can‚Äôt the staff in Paul make a decent coffee? 
Why are they not trained?
Why are the staff so rude when the customer explains the coffee is not good? 
In my opinion, one shot in a medium take away is not sufficient to make a decent coffee.",neutral

The pumpkin soup had unexpected flavors and it was just perfect. Likewise, the tomato soup was very tasty. The tuna avocado toast was smaller than I expected, but it was delicious and filling. Every pastry we tried was out of this world delicious: the crepe strawberry, millefeuille strawberry, cherry pie, strawberry pie, etc. Don't forget the cocktails! The Caribbean Sour was really good, and the raspberry drink with gin (the name escapes me) was even better.

It's really one of few perfect restaurants with a brand name, food is so delicious, large portion, menu with lots of verities, fair price for what you get it really worth it.
One thing happened this time wasn't professional which they brought the main course while I am still not finished my salad and I had to return it till I am finished (this point needs attention from managment).

It is a nice place, but too crowdy and when there is a lot of people inside, sometimes you have to sit so close to each other, like sticking to unknown person :D Anyway...i think Paul was much better 2 years ago.

I tried it 2x just to see if maybe the first time was a random occurrence but not at all. Both times my food was sub par. And for the price, there are better restaurants around in Port Baku with better food. Also if you are looking for french food, Paris Bistro is much better than Paul.

The staff is quick to show you to your seats and take order. The service has improved over time. The bread now comes warmed up and is served with butter and olive paste. 
We ordered couple of salads. The food arrived in time. The food is okay. The salad is bit limp probably due to excess dressing. Overall it is a good place for a quick meal.

I came with work once for a breakfast and the camembert sandwich was tasteless. It even gave me an indigestion for the rest of the day. 
Then I came at least 4 times to buy your baguette sandwiches. 1 out of 4 was decent.  The other 3, the bread was either chewy or stale. You are a boulangerie, at least get your bread right.

As far as the ambiance is concerned, the restaurant is very clean, though a bit noisy due to the hardwood floors.

The main course consisted of a ""Surprise Aux Salmon"" which really thrilled us.it all was followed by beetroot & pumpkin pur√©e.
All the products were fresh and dishes had warmth of home-food. The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients.The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best bakery & pastries of the region, which are fair costs.

Seats are comfortable with wooden finishing. Unfortunately these are only strong sides of place. After 10 minutes inside you feel like you are in a public transport. Everyone is talking with loud voice and tables are in close distance from one another. 
Service: Waiters were a kind of confused from the beginning. Two different waiters approached us asking if someone take orders from us. When meals were presented I had to ask two different waiters again for the fork.   
Food: From the food I've tried both onion and tomato soups were delicious. I also liked their burger. It was served with french fries and was huge. Only downside for the burger was waiters didn't ask me how I'd like to have it. Generally I prefer medium to well done, but burger served was medium to low. After first bite pinkish chunk of minced beef was staring at me.
Price: Well... with some plus and minus almost the same price as in other french cuisine restaurants like Merci Baku and Paris Bistro. Bill is fine for the meals but not for service and ambiance.",positive

On my last 3 visits (once for breakfast, once for lunch and once for dinner), there was a noticeable decline in service and quality. The pastries and breads are still of good quality, but the made-to-order food has been of average quality with a lack of attention to detail.

In fact, in terms of service, it was one of the best restaurants I've ever been in. On the strength of that I've visited Paul in both Paris and London and, whilst neither could match their Rabat cousin, they were pretty good.

Shame then that when I went to 'Paul, Baku' the experience couldn't have been more different. Outwardly it looks great, the same decor, the same gorgeous looking selection of patisserie in the window and arranged inside the glass counters within. Unfortunately that's where the good news ends. The first time I went was for lunch with a colleague. The food was okay but no better. However, the service was dire - there is no other way of putting it. It's not that it was short staffed - there were plenty people in waiters' costumes standing around avoiding eye contact. The second time was worse - I like to give people a second chance, we sat for some time watching five staff chatting and looking at their mobile phones having not received a menu or had a drinks order taken. At that point we left. It's a shame, with a decent Maitre D' the place could be good - but it isn't. Spend your money elsewhere.",positive

Paul Restaurant has the potential to live up to its franchise high standards but is does not.  On a whole the food is mediocre and bland.  You can sometimes come in, sit down and not be served for 10 to 15 minutes before you have to say ""Hey, I'm here!"".  Once you enter the restaurant you will notice eight to ten attendees or other service persons milling about but not paying attention to when someone enters and sits at a table.  This unfortunately happens 80 percent of the time.  Simple breakfast items sometimes talks over 30 minutes or longer before it arrives at your table.  The behind the counter staff that serve croissants and etc take an extraordinarily long time to package the items and eventually accept your money sans emotion or even a smile.   The floor staff appear poorly trained and lack a sense or urgency for the customer and don't track the customers orders until the customer complains due to an exceedingly long time waiting.  The music is too loud and distracting to the point where I've seen customers leaving their table to go outside so they could hear the caller.

It comes with or without tomato, also with or without hash brown.  Five times I got a hash brown, other three times I did not.  It's worth noting that the menu actually states that all omelettes come with hash browns, but when I pointed that out three times they brought me one once, other two times they said ""breakfast omelette does not come with hash browns"" even when I pointed out ""well the last five weekends it has done"".
It really depends on the waiter and the mood of the waiter.
Menu says ""choice of pastrie"" but when i said I would like Pain Au Chocolat they said ""no, you can only have three mini pastries"", again I had been given a Pain Au Chocolat several times before. Although the menu states plain omelette I had asked for and been given a mushroom omelette six out of the eight times, one of the times I was charged an extra three manats, even though I had explained I had been given it for free on the five previous occasions.

Was In today. My wife is azeri and she ordered (what we thought to be) 4 chicken pastry, 2 meat and 2 potato. Because that was it said on the little black signs in the front of the glass cabinet. 
However, when we got home. The chicken ones were mushroom. The meat ones were potato and the potato ones were chicken. 
The signs were wrong and the guy serving did not know the difference between each of the products he sells. And he has been there for a while. 

Now. Entree is pretty good usually. But today was the typical standard of service you get in Baku. Overall very poor service culture here. 

Also on a side note. I got a black roll with chicken and sun dried tomato. Why oh why do they feel the need to put dill in absolutely everything in this country. It‚Äôs disgusting.

Passing by a 'Gloria Jean's Coffee' place I got tempted to go for an espresso and a cake. As I found out later there are several branches in Baku of this now Sydney-based global coffeehouse chain, present in many countries, but not so much in Western Europe. In Greece, where I spend a lot of time, when one reads 'Gloria Jeans' by a shop, then they sell jeans, not coffee. 

It was 10pm and the place was empty, although official closing time is 11pm. At the counter was a friendly young man, from whom I ordered a 'Single Espresso' and a 'Lavender Blueberry Cake', that I saw displayed behind glass. The cake came on a porcelain plate, but the espresso in cardboard, the glass of water in a plastic cup and the cutlery was of plastic as well. I put it on all on a tray and sat down at one of several small round tables with two chairs.

The cake was excellent, so was the coffee. Wondering about the name of the place, I read that it goes back to a lady, called Gloria Jean Kvetko from Long Grove near Chicago, where she opened a coffeehouse iin 1979, the beginning of a long success story.",neutral

I had been away from home in Viet Nam for a week, and was a bit homesick for some form of Asian food.  So I was very surprised, and happy, to see Thai beef salad on the food menu.
So that was what I ordered for lunch, together with a large cappuccino.  
Well, the cappuccino came first, and it was huge.......almost the size of a soup bowl.  Could not complain about the taste, although the coffee was half-consumed by the time the food arrived.
On presentation, the salad looked good.  Lots of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, sliced carrot, radish, covered in a drizzle of sesame dressing.  However, the beef was disappointing: A couple of small gristley slices, which were not tasty at all.  I guess I should go back to Thailand for the authentic.
Service was average, but the location was good.  If I had my wife and daughter with me I would have called the restaurant cozy.  I had a small booth of the first floor by the window, and it was a good place to do some discreet people watching out on the pedestrian boulevard.
The cost of the meal was AZN13 (approx USD7.50), so not expensive.
